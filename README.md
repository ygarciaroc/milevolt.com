Hi
My name is Yammy and this is my responsive website to gather all the events, internships, conferences, and projects i've been a participant of or author of during my journey as a student 
in electrical engineering at the university of texas at el paso. I'm a beginner at making UIs and Front end development as well so this is another project itself to showcase those skills,
please feel free to take inspiration of this but don't take credit of my work or copy, all this work is owned by me.
