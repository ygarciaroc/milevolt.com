                When I started my path in Electrical Engineering, I didn’t imagine how quickly opportunities would shape my career. Becoming a Siemens EDA Ambassador gave me my first taste of bridging industry tools with education—I got to introduce classmates to design software and learn firsthand about the workflows used in real-world projects.

                Later, my internship with Microsoft expanded my horizons even further. I wasn’t just applying classroom theory; I was working alongside mentors who showed me how microelectronics ties into large-scale systems. I learned not only technical skills, like circuit analysis and design workflows, but also the importance of teamwork, communication, and confidence in presenting ideas.

                This experience reinforced my passion for engineering and reminded me of something important: careers aren’t built overnight—they’re built step by step, with each experience adding a new layer of skills and perspective.
