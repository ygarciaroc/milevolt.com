                The opportunities I've had, from my Intel cleanroom certificaion to my silicon engineer internship at Microsoft, have been key to building my toolkit and earning this recognition. The Intel certification didn't just give me skills; it gave me the independence to become a teaching assistance at my school among others master's and phd's students. This allowed me to continue my education without having to take on a side job that would have pulled me away from my studies and research.
            </p>

                My Microsoft internship wasn't just in some distant location; it was Silicon Valley, the heart of the tech world. This experience, combined with my research, has been the most important part of my engineering education. It's where theory and practice truly came tpgether, where I got to apply my knowledge of ransducers and impedance modeling in a real-world, high-stakes environment.
            </p>

                As first-generation female engineer, this recognition is so much more than a line on my resume. It's a testament to the hard work and sacrifice of my grandparents. My achievements are a small way of building the legacy they never got to see, adirect result of their courage to give me the opportunity to legally migrate and pursue a life they could only dream of. The article and poster presentation are not just my work; they are my way of showing them that their journey wasn't for nothing.
